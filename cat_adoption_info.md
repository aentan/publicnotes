### What will be your decision with your cats if you are going to have children / move overseas for work or study?

Our children (just one actually) love our animals.
We'd move our pets wherever we go.

### If you are an overseas expatriate working in Singapore we need to know concrete plans of what happens to the cat if you should return to your home country or go to other countries to work or study. We also need to know your residency status and length of stay in Singapore.
